#including header files from different directory while using terminal GCC:

Using g++, you can use the -I option to specify an alternate include directory:
g++ -o main -I/source/includes main.cpp

There is no space after the -I.

#A nice tip
To maximize the chance that missing includes will be flagged by compiler, order your #includes as follows:

    The paired header file
    Other headers from your project
    3rd party library headers
    Standard library headers

The headers for each grouping should be sorted alphabetically (unless the documentation for a 3rd party library instructs you to do otherwise).
