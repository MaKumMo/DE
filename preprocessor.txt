Some important preprocessor directives are :
#include --> Used for including files in a code. Include statement is replaced by code in the file that is included.

Macro Defines --> #define is used. It replaces or substitues the text throughout our code.

Conditional compilation --> The conditional compilation preprocessor directives allow you to specify under what conditions something will or won’t compile

Some common types of condtional compilations are :
#ifdef, #ifndef, and #endif

if def compiles the code if we have something defined already.
ifndef does the exact opposite.If something is defined than it will not compile.

Another conditional  compilation is #if 0.This will just not compile code in the defined area. #endif is used to determine the range.
On the other hand changing #if 0 --> #if 1 will instead compile the code.

Important note: Object-like macros don’t affect other preprocessor directives

Preprocesssor Directives have global scope and they wont affect multiple files.
