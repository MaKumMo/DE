1) From my understanding , Namespace is like a city where you can store different identifiers. Nomrally you have a global namspace and std namspace.
2) "using namspace std" is bad idea because it may have naming collisions. If you create a function with identifier similar to something from namespace
    std than you are fucked. So instead it's preferrable to just use the std::cout i.e std prefix before the function that you want to use.
